* Requirements

[[./install.sh][install.sh]] should install the required libraries on a standard Ubuntu rig.
It requires =sudo= several times. Python packages are installed in the user directory.

* Learning

Run =run_all.sh= to reproduce the learners on the paper.
Results are stored in =samples/= subdirectory.
Some experiments take about 30 minutes to complete on GTX1070.

Note that the action model generated by the learner is different each time.

* Planning

Run from the root directory the scripts in =experiments/= =more-experiments/= =noise-experiments/=.
