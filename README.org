* LatPlan : A domain-independent, image-based classical planner

+ *NEWS* Initial release: Published after AAAI18.
+ *NEWS* Updates on version 2: Mainly the refactoring. AAAI18 experiments still works.
+ *NEWS* Updates on version 2.1: Version 2 was not really working and I could finally have time to fix it. Added ZSAE experiments.
+ *NEWS* Updates on version 2.2: Backported more minor improvements from the private repository
+ *NEWS* Updates on version 3.0: Updates for DSAMA system. More refactoring is done on the learner code.
  We newly introduced ama3-planner which takes a PDDL domain file.
+ *NEWS* Updates on version 4.0: Updates for Cube-Space AE in IJCAI2020 paper.
  This is a version that can exploit the full potential of search heuristics (lower bounds in Branch-and-Bound),
  such as LM-cut or Bisimulation Merge-and-Shrink in Fast Downward.
  We now included a script for 15-puzzle instances randomly sampled from the states
  14 or 21 steps away from the goal.
  We also included a script for Korf's 100 instances of 15-puzzle, but the accuracy
  was not sufficient in those problems where the shortest path length are typically around 50.
  Problems that require deeper searches also require more model accuracy because
  errors accumulate in each state transition.

[[./install.sh][install.sh]] should install the required libraries on a standard Ubuntu rig.
It requires =sudo= several times. However Python packages are installed in the user directory.
(We plan to migrate to =conda= and =pip=-based dependency resolution soon.)

Next, customize the following files for your job scheduler before running.
The job submission commands are stored in a variable =$common=, which by default
has the value like =jbsub -mem 32g -cores 1+1 -queue x86_24h=.
You also need to uncomment the commands to run.
By default, everything is commented out and nothing runs.

#+begin_src sh
# You first need to set up a dataset.
./setup-dataset.sh

# This script launches the training for Cube-Space AEs, as well as SAEs used for AMA2.
./train_all.sh

# This script extracts PDDL files from the Cube-Space AE training results.
./train_others.sh

# This script launches the training for AAE, AD and SD for AMA2.
# The number of actions in AAE is tuned by the hyperparameter tuner.
./train_aae.sh

# This script trains AAEs with a fixed number of actions without tuning.
# It was used in the SAE + Cube-AAE experiments.
./train_aae-fixedactions.sh

# When the training finished, generate the problem instances.
# This script samples the initial states from the frontier of dijkstra search.
(cd problem-instances; ./example-dijkstra.sh)
# This script generates 15-puzzle instances.
(cd problem-instances-16; ./example-dijkstra.sh)
# This script generates Korf's 100 instances for 15-puzzle.
(cd problem-instances-16-korf; ./example-korf.sh)


# modify these scripts to adjust the job submission commands for your job scheduler.
./run_ama2_all.sh 
./run_ama3_all.sh 
./run_ama3_all-16.sh
./run_ama3_all-16-korf.sh
./run_ama3_all-cube-aae.sh

# after the experiments, run this script to generate the tables and figures.
# for details read the source code
./generate-all-csv.sh

#+end_src

** Required software

Python 3.5 or later is required.

On Ubuntu, prerequisites can be installed via launching [[./install.sh]] .
The script compiles several C++ and Lisp binaries. However, it does not affect the
running system (e.g. installing a custom software under =/usr/=) except for
performing several =apt-get install= from the official ubuntu repository.

The applications installed by the script consists of:

+ =mercurial g++ cmake make python flex bison g++-multilib= --- these are required for compiling Fast Downward.

+ =git build-essential automake libcurl4-openssl-dev= --- these are required for compiling [Roswell](http://roswell.github.io/). OSX users should use =brew install roswell=.

+ =gnuplot= --- for plotting.

+ =parallel= --- for running some scripts. If you haven't used it yourself, give it a try! It is a very nice tool.

+ =python3-pip python3-pil= --- python packages.

+ =tensorflow keras h5py matplotlib progressbar2 timeout_decorator ansicolors scipy scikit-image imageio= --- more python packages.

+ =bash-completion byobu htop mosh= These are not necessary :) but I just use this script also for setting up the environment in a new machine.

+ tests/ :: test files, mostly the unit tests for domain generator/validator
+ samples/ :: where the learned results should go. Each SAE training results are stored in a subdirectory.
+ puzzles/ :: code for domain generators/validators.
  + puzzles/*.py :: each file represents a domain. 
  + puzzles/model/*.py :: the core model (successor rules etc.) of the domain. this is disentangled from the images.
